q.2
Let’s create a flowchart for the user login process with conditional paths for successful and unsuccessful login attempts, along with the account lock feature after three failed attempts. Here’s a simple flowchart to illustrate this process:




       GO         

        |
        

 Enter Username/Password

        |
        

 Check process	      

        |
  
 Successful Login      
 (Continue to App)     

        |
        

 Unsuccessful Login    

        |
        
  Failed Attempts      

        |
     
  Check Attempts     
      V
  
  Lock Account

      |
      
    End            




now explnn:-

1. GO: Begin the login process.
2. Enter Username/Password
3. Check OR Verify if the entered credentials are correct.
   - If credentials are correct, move to "Successful Login" path.
   - If credentials are incorrect, move to "Unsuccessful Login" path.
4. Successful Login: User successfully logING 
5. Unsuccessful Login: Increment the count of failed login attempts.
6. Increment Failed Attempts:** Keep track of the number of failed attempts.
7. Check Attempts: Check if the number of failed attempts has reached three.
   If yes, move to "Lock Account" path.
    If no, return to "Enter Username/Password" to allow another login attempt.
8. Lock Account- Account is locked due to three consecutive failed attempts.
9. End:
