q.2
Let’s create a flowchart for the user login process with conditional paths for successful and unsuccessful login attempts, along with the account lock feature after three failed attempts. Here’s a simple flowchart to illustrate this process:

```

Flowchart Explanation:

1. GO: Begin the login process.
2. Enter Username/Password
3. Check OR Verify if the entered credentials are correct.
   - If credentials are correct, move to "Successful Login" path.
   - If credentials are incorrect, move to "Unsuccessful Login" path.
4. Successful Login: User successfully logING 
5. **Unsuccessful Login:** Increment the count of failed login attempts.
6. **Increment Failed Attempts:** Keep track of the number of failed attempts.
7. **Check Attempts: Check if the number of failed attempts has reached three.
   - If yes, move to "Lock Account" path.
   - If no, return to "Enter Username/Password" to allow another login attempt.
8. **Lock Account:** Account is locked due to three consecutive failed attempts.
9. **End:
