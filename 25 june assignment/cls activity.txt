 * Binary search algorithm.
 * Purpose: Search a given element in the given sorted array.
 * Algorithm main idea / intension: Search algoritm that find the position of the target value within the sorted array. Half of the array is eliminated
 * during each "step". * Time Complexity:
 ** The time complexity of Binary Search is O(log n), where n represents the number of elements in the sorted array. ** It follows a divide-and-conquer approach, reducing the search space in half at each iteration.
 ** The logarithmic behavior ensures efficient searching even for large arrays. * Space Complexity:
 ** The space complexity of the iterative Binary Search is O(1) (constant). ** It uses a fixed amount of extra space, regardless of the input array size. ** No additional data structures or recursion are involved.
 * In summary, Binary Search efficiently locates an element within a sorted array, */
