Complete this assignment 1:
/*
// Linear Search
// List arr = {23, 56, 67, 78};
// Repeat searching one by one until search element is found
for( i = 0; i < n ; i++) // This will repeat the code inside block n times
{
    // to access element you do arr[0] = first element
    // to access ith element you do arr[i]
    complete the code and return the positon of the found element else return -1
    Write pseudocode, algorithm or C code is also fine


ans--
in this ass. we have -- {23, 56, 67, 78}

Num of elmm we havee- 4
src elm = 67
