Binary search algorithm
1. Take Input array arr = {34, 45, 78, 78, 90, 100};
2. search element, equals 'x' say
3. mid index is denoted by mid, left index by left and right index by right
4. Repeat this below step until left <= right till ste
5. mid = left + (right - left) / 2 (mid position in array)
6. See if the searched element is present at the mid position i.e. x == arr[mid], if this the case return or print mid postion
   stating search element is found at mid position and stop the searching.
7. If search element if(x > arr[mid]) then it sorted list we can be sure that our new left index to be shifted to mid + 1
8. If search element if(x < arr[mid]) then it sorted list we can be sure that our new right index to be shifted to mid -1
9. Repeat step 4


ans- 

 intput arr[] = {34, 45, 78, 78, 90, 100};
and the element you want to find (x).

i set two point left to the beginning of the array (0) and right to the end (n-1 where n is the number of elements).
Calculate the middle index mid as left + (right - left) / 2.


elm of x = 78
      34, 45, 78, 78, 90, 100
index 0    1   2   3   4   5
now w see set left = 0
and right 5
in this case we find 2 indexx
